	<h2> Free Draw</h2>
<p> I think animal prints are really unique and pretty, therefore I attempted to do a design with a variety of them while also trying to put a twist to it and add color. The pink area was supposed to be leapord print but I wasn't able to do it because I didnt have enough tools.</p>

<h2> Mommy and Me</h2>
	<p> This piece of art was made of baby tomatoes that I had home. I was searching through my Refrigerator and came across these tomatoes. Since there was different sizes, I came up with the idea to have a mommy and a baby.</p>

<h2> Celebrity Animation</h2>
<p> Back then during quaretine, my favorite artist was Billie Eilish. This piece of art was created because my teacher asked us to make a moving animation, aka GIF, so I recreated Billie Eilish off an app.</p>

	<h2>Paper Turkey</h2>
<p> During this time, we were learning all about origami and how to create different things with paper. Since it was November and thanksgiving was coming up, I decided to create an origami turkey.</p>

	<h2> Surprise!</h2>
	<p> In this assignment we used some origami techniques in order to show two sides of a drawing depending of how the paper is folded.</p>

<h2> Letter Drawing</h2>
<p> In this assignment we were asked to use our creativity and create a drawing using a letter or shape. I decided to use the letter B and it reminded me of a Bear. Therefore, I drew a bear next to a jar of honey</p>
